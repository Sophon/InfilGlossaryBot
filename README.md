# InfilGlossaryBot

A Discord bot that searches the fighting-game glossary.

The glossary used: https://glossary.infil.net/

![CleanShot 2023-06-14 at 00 07 07](https://github.com/Sophon/InfilGlossaryBot/assets/9089332/93abffe4-5470-4868-9106-e23ae8a59054)

This bot is still very barebones.

Some TODOs:
- separate the business logic and the Discord code
- properly format links
- clickable links
- Discord output formatting
- game the term is used in
- JP definitions
